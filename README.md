- 👋 Hi, I’m @Daniel-Cube
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science and making video games. Hopefully the knowledge I gain will help to achieve my goals
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to GitHub, more C++ and Java, Math, and more at Old Dominion University
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on C++ and coding so I can eventually be able to make my own video games or be apart of a team of people who make video games 
- 📫 How to reach me is dcobbs1999@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: Him/He
